# Welcome to Gnosari AI Teams

**Gnosari AI Teams** is a powerful framework for orchestrating multi-agent teams using Large Language Models. Create intelligent AI agent swarms that collaborate through streaming delegation and dynamic tool discovery.

## What is Gnosari AI Teams?

Gnosari AI Teams enables you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems where AI agents can:

- 🤝 **Delegate tasks** to specialized agents in real-time
- 🔧 **Discover and use tools** dynamically through MCP servers
- 📚 **Query knowledge bases** for context-aware responses
- 🌐 **Make API calls** to external services
- 🗄️ **Query databases** for data-driven decisions
- 📊 **Stream responses** for real-time collaboration

## Key Features

### Multi-Provider LLM Support
Each agent can use different models from various providers:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- DeepSeek
- Google (Gemini)
- And more...

### Task Delegation
Agents use the delegate_agent tool to send tasks to other agents and receive responses, enabling seamless multi-agent coordination.

### Tool Integration
- Built-in tools (delegate_agent, api_request, knowledge_query, mysql_query, website_content, file_operations)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Dynamic tool discovery

### Knowledge Bases
Embedchain integration for RAG capabilities with support for:
- Websites
- YouTube videos
- Documents
- And more...
